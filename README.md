# Arrays
Some cool and famous problems involving the use of Arrays

## Two Number Sum
When given an array and a target sum, return 2 numbers that when summed equate to the targetSum.

If the array is sorted we can have a left and right pointer. Adjust the left and right pointers based on the current sum. O(n) time, O(1)space.

If the array is unsorted we can use a hashset to search for the next number needed to equate to the targetSum. O(n) time, O(1) space.
